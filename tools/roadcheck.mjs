// The editor will let you draw anything: up a cliff, out to sea, ending in mid
// air. The generator will not - a road too steep is a road the car cannot climb,
// a water crossing longer than `CITY_MAX_BRIDGE` is not a bridge, and a road
// whose ends touch nothing is pruned the moment it is laid.
//
// So this is the gate between the drawing and the city. It asks four questions
// of a hand-edited network, all of them ones the generator will ask later and
// none of them visible on the map:
//
//   1. Where does it cross water, and can that crossing be built?
//   2. How steep does it get?
//   3. Do both ends join something?
//   4. Is the whole network still one piece, with every place on it?
