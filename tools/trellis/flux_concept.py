"""Concept images of an original coupe with local FLUX.1-schnell (Apache-2.0).

Why: TRELLIS.2 only adds detail when its input already has it (see
docs/research/car-pilot-trellis.md, Runs 1 and 2), so the input has to be a
detailed concept image from a licence-clean source. The prompt names no real
car. Prompt, seed, model and date go to `<out>/log.json` for the credits row.
