/**
 * Headlights (#221).
 *
 * A playtest liked the run into night and then said the obvious thing about it:
 * "headlights would be good, currently very dark at night otherwise". Cars had
 * tail lights and nothing at the front, so an oncoming car after dark was a
 * dark shape and the road ahead was unlit.
 *
 * These are cheap structural checks rather than a judgement about how it looks -
 * that is what `HOUR=2 npm run cityshot -- --view hour` is for. What they catch
 * is the light going out: a rename, a reordered child list, or a pool that
 * stops being told what time it is.
