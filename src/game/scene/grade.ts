/**
 * The colour grade (#580, part of #11): behind the `grade` look switch.
 *
 * The reference frames are not saturated and not contrasty. Blacks sit lifted
 * and cool, highlights drift warm, colour is pulled toward grey, and the whole
 * frame has a faint vignette. Our flat Lambert boxes at full saturation are
 * the opposite, so this is the cheapest single change that moves a frame
 * toward the target.
 *
 * It runs in the renderer's effect chain, so its input is linear HDR and
 * *before* ACES: the contrast curve pivots on mid grey (0.18) and the lift
 * is small, because ACES will crush whatever it is handed. Tune by looking at
 * `npm run looksheet -- --look 'none;grade'`, not by the numbers.
