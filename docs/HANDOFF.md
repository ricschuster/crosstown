# Session handoff

Where the project stands, so a fresh session can pick it up without re-deriving
anything. This is a solo project: see [CONTRIBUTING](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

- **Update (2026-10-04): Kestrel nose, tail and paint done; brake lights then Tier 2 next (#620, #584).**
  The owner asked to improve the Kestrel further; the plan is issue **#620**
  (checkboxes, Tier 1 then Tier 2). Read it, then the "Nose and tail" and
  "Paint" entries in [docs/research/car-pilot-trellis.md](research/car-pilot-trellis.md).
  - **Done and merged:** nose (grille bars, corner intakes, splitter, hood
    bulge and vents) and tail (plate recess, diffuser, round exhaust tips);
    paint 2a clear coat plus flake (`lacquer()` in `scene/glbcar.ts`), 2b baked
    occlusion and edge light (`bake_light()` in `tools/cars/kestrel.py`), 2c
    physical dirt (`shade()`, one knob `DIRT`), 2d damage wear (`wearPaint()`
    called from the view's wear block, sim untouched), 2e reflective glass and
    matte trim.
  - **Next, owner's order:** Tier 1 item 3, **brake lights** (the view must read
    the sim's brake, read-only; tail lamps and the halos from `addLampHalos`
    brighten on braking, day and night). Then Tier 2 in #620. The body-style kit
    and making `models` a default look stay parked (HANDOFF "end of night 2").
    **The owner said not to worry about the triangle budget for now.**
  - **Lessons that will bite again:** a part that must take the car's colour has
    to be joined into `a_body` in Blender (the loader repaints only that mesh; a
    separate painted part rendered white in game while Blender looked fine); a
    strongly metallic base with a hard coat washes red and white out to pink,
    keep the base near 12% metallic; `patch` is a reserved word in GLSL; a mesh
    without the bake's colour attribute must not ask for vertex colours or it
    draws black; the scuff noise is skipped at zero wear, which also made the
    software-rendered night shot stop timing out. **Always look in the game, not
    just the Blender preview.**
  - **How I looked:** a throwaway Playwright script (not committed): start vite,
    open `/?look=<all defaults>,models`, respray through
    `crosstown.world.resprays.set(world.car.id, '#hex')`, set
    `crosstown.world.damage`, wrap `crosstown.view.director.update` to pull the
    camera in with `position.lerp(target, 0.45)` (0.7 puts it inside the car),
    clip the screenshot. Each shot takes about a minute in SwiftShader; pass
    `timeout` to `page.screenshot`. `cityshot` still fails about every other
    launch; rerun.
  - **Dev server:** one on port 5190 serves the old working directory
    (`handoff-trellis-pilot`, which has all of this); stop it by PID only, never
    `pkill -f`.
  - **Continue with this prompt:**

- **Update (2026-10-03, end of night 2): car pilot passes 3 and 4 done, kit is next (#584).**
  On top of the route D entry below (read it for the pipeline and the gotchas):
  - **Pass 3, detail (`952f3b9`):** shut lines as ray-cast ribbons (`seam()`),
    lamp bezels, a spoiler blade, twin-spoke rims with lug nuts, firmer
    shoulder, dark mirrors. 29.3k triangles, 1.4 MB.
  - **Night lamps (`f9f97be`):** `addLampHalos` / `setHalos` in `scene/cars.ts`,
    additive sprites on head and tail lamps, faded by `CarPool.setNight` and
    `CityView.setCarNight`. Not done: brake lights (the view does not read the
    sim's brake).
  - **Lessons:** tagging shell faces for fine lines or bezels is pixelated (use
    ribbons and blobs); a raised tail lip in the `BELT` curve folds the loft and
    the car goes dark and blotchy in the game while Blender looks fine, so
    **always check in the game, not just the preview**; `hit()` flips normals to
    face the ray because the shell's face normals can point inward.
  - **`cityshot` fails about every other launch** (Node exits with no message);
    just rerun. `HOUR=23 LOOK=<defaults>,models npm run cityshot -- --view hour`
    is the night shot.
  - **Next, owner's order: (b) the body-style kit.** Nothing is written. Plan:
    parameterise `kestrel.py` by body style from `BODIES` in
    `scene/carshape.ts` (length, height, width, glass position and length,
    roofFront/roofBack slope, nose, tail, tyre, track, lift, open, bed, spoiler,
    stripe); remap the Kestrel's `ROOF`/`BELT` keys piecewise through the cabin
    breakpoints so `fastback` stays what it is; place lamps, mirrors and seams
    relative to the cabin, not in fixed metres; one .glb per body. **Size is the
    decision to take with the owner first:** 16 bodies at 1.4 MB is over any
    sensible budget (the body is 1 MB of it), so subdivision level 1 for all but
    the hero, shared wheels, and loading per body on demand are the levers;
    check whether the generated service worker precaches `public/models`.
    Loader work: `kestrelParts()` is fastback-only and `makeCar` checks
    `style === 'fastback'`. Then (d) make `models` a default look (#579 rule).
  - **Dev server:** one on port 5190 may still run from this directory; stop it
    by PID only, never `pkill -f`.
  - **Continue with this prompt:**

- **Update (2026-10-03, night): car pilot, three routes tried; route D (scripted Blender) is the one the owner liked (#584).**
  Full write-up with every attempt: [docs/research/car-pilot-trellis.md](research/car-pilot-trellis.md) (Runs 1-5).
  - **Result so far:** *Wheels are a huge improvement; the rest are improvements
    too but need more work; handling feels much better* (owner, after driving it
    with `?look=models`). The handling is #617's body motion plus real steering
    wheels; the sim and the `citylap` baselines are untouched.
  - **Route D, built:** `tools/cars/kestrel.py` authors the Kestrel in headless
    Blender (lofted shell, subdivision, creases, boolean arches, separate glass,
    lamps, mirrors, four wheels with tyre, rim, disc, caliper). `blender -b -P
    tools/cars/kestrel.py -- public/models/kestrel.glb PREVIEW_PREFIX` writes the
    model (27.4k triangles, 1.7 MB) and five preview renders;
    `python3 tools/cars/sheet.py PREFIX` makes a contact sheet. Loader:
    `src/game/scene/glbcar.ts`, behind **`?look=models`, off by default** (a bare
    `?look=models` turns the other defaults off; use
    `?look=env,pbr,materials,trees,particles,clutter,buildings,models`, and
    `LOOK=` the same way for `cityshot`). Replaces fastback bodies that are not
    police. Original work, nothing generated: **no credits row**.
  - **Two bugs worth remembering:** GLTFLoader splits a multi-material node into
    a mesh per material (merge wheels back, keep the paint primitive as
    `children[0]`); and the paint material must be cloned per car, because parked
    cars of the same body repaint a shared one.
  - **Route E, not taken:** TRELLIS.2 on FLUX.1-schnell concept images works
    (`tools/trellis/flux_concept.py`, `run.py`, `render_glb.py`; seed 1 of the
    unbranded prompt is the pick) and looks better than D at chase distance, but
    the wheels are fused and the glass is a blob; the wheel fix is about half a
    day per car. **FLUX with a "no real car" prompt still drew Toyota and Mustang
    badges: look at every image.** Parked, not rejected: the owner chose D. The
    Copilot-account concept image was an experiment and is in no commit.
  - **Pass 3 done (2026-10-03): (a) detail** - seams, bezels, spoiler blade, twin-spoke rims, firmer shoulder; see Run 5 "Pass 3" in the research note. Night lamps (c) done too: lamp halos, see the research note. Still open: (b) kit, (d) default look. The nose and tail are still plain.
  - **Open on D (owner's call which first):** (a) detail: hood line, lamp
    recesses, spoiler lip, rim detail, a firmer shoulder; (b) a kit: turn the
    script into parameter sets so the other 15 body styles come out of it,
    budgeted against the 10 MB asset cap; (c) lamp glow at night (`headlight`
    nodes are unlit basic materials, untested at night); (d) if signed off, make
    `models` a default look and delete the switch name (#579 rule).
  - **Dev server:** one was left on port 5190 from this working directory
    (`npx vite --port 5190 --strictPort`); stop only that PID, never `pkill -f`.
  - **Continue with this prompt:**
    > Continue the car pilot (#584), route D. Read docs/HANDOFF.md (the

- **Update (2026-10-03, late night): AI assets allowed; car sourcing is a pilot (#584).**
  The owner asked to consider "considerably" better cars, ruled out nothing, is
  **not an artist and will not hire one**, and said the no-AI rule made no sense
  for a project an AI wrote. [ADR-0013](decisions/0013-ai-generated-assets-and-car-models.md)
  lifts it (original, licence-clean, a credits row each; prompts never name a
  real car) and sets the plan: **motion first** (body roll, dive, squat, spinning
  and steering wheels, light glow; view-side only), then a **pilot on one car**
  with a shared glTF pipeline, comparing scripted-Blender (D) against
  image-to-3D (E, local on the RTX 3090) in the city, in motion. Procedural cars
  stay the fallback. **Blender 5.2.2 is installed** (`snap`); run it headless
  (`blender -b -P`). Nothing is built yet. Check the licence of TRELLIS and
  Hunyuan3D before downloading either (Hunyuan's is believed to exclude some
  territories; unverified). Owner has still not seen the cars in motion.
- **Update (2026-10-03, evening): the car pilot is set up, not yet run (#584, ADR-0013 route E).**
  Full notes, licences and gotchas: [docs/research/car-pilot-trellis.md](research/car-pilot-trellis.md).
  - **Merged first:** ADR-0013 (#616: AI assets allowed, one credits row each,
    cars are a pilot) and the player's-car motion (#617: lean, dive, squat,
    wheels turn and steer). Motion is judged in the city by the owner, who has
    not yet seen it.
  - **Pilot car: the Kestrel** (`fastback`). Input is a render of our own
    procedural model (`node tools/carview.mjs fastback '#d8442f' OUT`), never
    anything from `reference/`. Model: TRELLIS.2 (MIT) with the DINOv3 encoder
    (gated, Meta's licence, owner's access granted). Both are downloaded
    (about 16 GB), `hf auth login` is done.
  - **Update (2026-10-03, night): install finished and `run.py` works.** The
    env is `trellis2` (`~/micromamba-bin/bin/micromamba run -n trellis2 python
    tools/trellis/run.py IMG OUT --type 512`); one fix was needed (transformers
    5 renamed DINOv3's `.layer`, aliased in `run.py`). A 512 run takes about
    two minutes and 2.8 GB of GPU. Results, with pictures in
    `~/Pictures/crosstown-compare/`: see the Results section of the research
    note. Short version: with a detailed photoreal input it looks good at
    chase-cam distance, but the wheels are fused into the body, the glass is a
    blob and it is 200k triangles; with our own low-poly Kestrel render as the
    input it copies the car and adds nothing. So the input must be a detailed
    concept image from a licence-clean source.
  - **Not usable, experiment only:** the first concept image came from the
    owner's employer's Copilot account. It, its .glb and its renders never go
    in the repo, the credits or the game.
  - **FLUX.1-schnell** (Apache-2.0) is fully downloaded (23 GB transformer, in
    the HF cache; `du` on the snapshot folder misleadingly shows 454 MB because
    of symlinks) and the `flux` micromamba env has diffusers 0.40. Not run yet.
  - **`briaai/RMBG-2.0`** is what TRELLIS's `pipeline.json` uses to remove
    backgrounds: gated, believed non-commercial, not licence-checked, not
    downloaded. `run.py` stubs it and cuts the car out itself.
  - **Gotcha:** the car group has a blob-shadow plane (about 2340 x 6792 units)
    that wrecks `Box3` measurements; remove it before measuring.
  - **Next:** generate original-coupe concept images with FLUX.1-schnell
    (prompt names no real car; keep prompt, seed and date for the credits row),
    run TRELLIS on the best, then decide the wheels: replace them with our own
    at the hub positions (reuses #617's spin and steer). Judge in the chase
    camera, not close up. Nothing merges without a credits row. If it does not
    beat the procedural cars the procedural cars stay.
- **Update (2026-10-03, night): cars pass (#584), procedural, #610-#614 merged.**
  Owner delegated ("go as far as you can", then "keep going"), so sourcing is
  **better procedural shapes**: no asset, no `CREDITS.md` row, all 44 cars.
  - **Shape** (`scene/carshape.ts`): a body is a loft (26 stations x 15 points:
    deck line, rounded plan, lifted ends, haunches over the wheels, crowned
    deck) plus a 4-ring greenhouse loft. Roof plate, pillars, mirrors, wing and
    bed walls are painted and share the body material, so the pool's one
    repaint colours them; every painted geometry carries a `color` attribute
    (baked flank shading), so anything added with `bodyMaterial` needs one too
    (`add` does it). Extras: arches, rims (star dish), bumpers, grille, plate,
    exhausts, door lines, stripes. Sixteen `BodyShape`s; roster assignments in
    `docs/research/car-roster.md`. Wheels sit at `wheelX`, proud of the haunch.
  - **Where it is used** (`scene/cars.ts`): `makeCar` adds `parts.extras`, a tail
    light bar for `STRIP_TAIL` shapes; traffic shapes are dealt by `trafficBody`
    and cops by `COP_BODY`, both view-side so the sim and RNG are untouched.
  - **Shots** (`tools/lookshots.mjs`, `npm run looksheet -- --shot X --look all`;
    the default column is `none`): `carclose`, `carrear`, `carsun`, `carnight`,
    `body-<shape>`, `body-pickup-rear`. A shot's `car` drives a roster car with
    `world.drive`; `orbit`/`reach`/`lift`/`fov` is a free camera round it (the
    car is 4.8 m wide; suv and pickup need `fov` 62 or they fill the frame).
    Judged on stills only; **the owner has not seen it in motion.**
  - **Left:** rims still read as a big dark pentagon; headlights are boxes;
    wrecks are drawn as saloon or suv by scale; five hypers and two muscle cars
    share a silhouette each; no interior, no wipers or aerials; the player's car
    has no model-year touches. #579-#583 are still open on GitHub (close only
    on the owner's word). HUD (#586), weather (#585) and races stay parked.
- **Update (2026-10-03, close of the day): every look switch is a default; next is cars (#584).**
  - **State:** #607 (building kit) and #608 (all seven switches default:
    env, pbr, materials, trees, particles, clutter, buildings; `?look=none` is
    the plain city; `DEFAULT_LOOK` in `scene/look.ts`) are merged. #609 (branch
    `look-contact-shadow`, auto-merge armed) adds a contact shadow under every
    car (`cars.ts`, name `contact`, on with the clearcoat paint); it is subtle
    and invisible in shaded streets. That finishes #580 step 6. Docks shot now
    frames a door (stand-off is `(cos a, -sin a)`). Grep `origin/main` for #609
    and run `git log origin/main..look-contact-shadow` before trusting this.
  - **Issues #579-#583 are still open on GitHub** though the work is in; close
    with the owner's word. #583 has one leftover: a framed still of each
    landmark (they hide among downtown towers from any road; needs a camera
    aimed at the building, a tool change), and a unit test per landmark.
  - **Cars (#584), not started.** What exists: 44 `CarProfile`s in `cars.ts`
    (multipliers only, `docs/research/car-roster.md`), eight shared body shapes
    in `scene/carshape.ts` (`BODIES`: coupe, hatch, saloon, roadster, frame,
    wedge, suv, pickup) built as deformed boxes with a greenhouse and four
    cylinder wheels; `scene/cars.ts` `makeCar` adds lights and the contact
    shadow; `CarPool` repaints `children[0]` (the body must stay the first
    child). Paint is Lambert, or `MeshPhysicalMaterial` clearcoat under `pbr`.
    **Sourcing is the owner's call and is undecided** (CC0 bases, hand
    modelling, or better procedural shapes); ask first. AI-generated assets are
    ruled out, and each car must read as its stand-in without copying it.
  - **Parked:** HUD (#586, wait for the owner), weather and wet roads (#585, no
    weather flag early), races. The owner has not been asked about the car
    paint in motion; #608 made it default.
- **Update (2026-10-03, end of day): the owner has seen the building kit in motion and approved it.**
  PR #607 (`look-buildings`, auto-merge armed) holds all three passes. The
  owner drove `?look=all` with the spawn moved downtown (a local, uncommitted
  edit, since reverted) and said "Looks great! Approved." That is the kit
  only: `LOOK_SWITCHES` is still env, pbr, materials (walls), trees, particles,
  clutter, buildings, and none is a default yet. Whether `buildings` becomes
  the default is the first question next session (a one-line change in
  `scene/look.ts`; ask, do not assume). Open items: framed stills of a loading
  dock and of each landmark; then HUD (#586), weather (#585), cars (#584).
- **Update (2026-10-03, late night): #583 building kit, first pass, `?look=buildings` (PR #607).**
  `scene/buildingkit.ts` derives detail from a model's own parts, in metres,
  before `grown` scales it (`kitted` in `setpieces.ts`): sills and lintels from
  the window boxes; mullions on ribbon windows and glass towers; trim bands on
  stone and deco towers; cornice, parapet and roof plant (kept to the front of
  the roof, the models put tanks at the back); ground-floor piers, door
  canopies, shopfront risers, transoms and mullions; a tower entrance canopy;
  sheds get ribs, bay canopies and bollards. Kinds: townhouse, loft, midrise,
  shop, flat, apartment, tower, warehouse. Not house, villa, manor or the
  landmarks. Nothing sits more than half a metre proud of a wall below the
  cornice (the sim collides with the footprint).
  - **Shots** (`tools/lookshots.mjs`): `terrace`, `skyline`, `roofs` (chase camera
    lifted 7 m: `lift` is in world units times 135, 45 put it a kilometre up),
    `crowns` (lift 25, back 150). `npm run looksheet -- --shot roofs --look 'none;buildings'`.
  - **Judged on stills only; not a default.** Sills are faint at this wall tone.
  - **Second pass (same PR):** tower podium (stone skin, glazing bays, piers,
    cap, within 0.55 m), house/villa/manor (plinth, sills, lintels, shutters,
    door surround and step, chimney caps, manor quoins), silo (seam rings,
    ladder, rail, hatch). Shots `suburb` (seen) and `silos` (aimed along the
    road, silos out of frame: unseen, only unit-tested).
  - **Third pass:** loading docks (bumpers, yellow frame, leveller plate, roof
    vents, downpipes), landmarks (`LANDMARKS` in `buildingkit.ts`: chateau,
    city hall, gallery, cathedral, library, stadium, cruise terminal, dome,
    lookout and twist towers; the flatiron already had its cornice). Shots
    `silos` (rings seen), `civic`, `terracedusk` (kit reads at dusk; windows
    are lit by the sim, untouched). Landmarks and docks are seen only in part:
    `civic` shows the lookout tower's piers, not the cathedral or hall; a
    `docks` shot never framed a warehouse door (the stand-off by `angle` did
    not work), so it was dropped and the dock kit is unit-tested only.
  - **Not done:** a framed still of each landmark and of a loading dock;
    a unit test per landmark beyond a count.
  - After the merge: `git log origin/main..look-buildings` for stranded commits.
- **Update (2026-10-03, night): #581 and #582 are done (#605 merged).** Merged:
  #597-#605 (clouds and tunnel, ADR-0012, walls, weathering, leaf-card trees,
  dust, photo asphalt as default, autumn trees and wires, deck rails, guardrail
  and bend kerbs). After each merge, `git log origin/main..<branch>` for stranded commits.
  - **`LOOK_SWITCHES` is env, pbr, materials, trees, particles, clutter.**
    The owner has not seen the car in motion; ask before defaulting any. To see
    them: `npm run dev`, then `?look=trees,particles,clutter`, `?look=all` etc.
    `LOOK=trees,clutter npm run cityshot` now honours the switches too.
    **Photo asphalt with its wheel-track wear is the default** (owner,
    2026-10-03); walls are the only part of `materials` still switched.
  - **Materials (ADR-0012, `scene/materials.ts`, `materials/CREDITS.md`):**
    CC0 from ambientCG, JPEG via Vite `?url`, 10 MB cap (1.3 MB used), 1K maps.
    Asphalt on carriageways through `worldUvs`; walls on set pieces by wall
    colour (`WALL_FINISH_BY_COLOUR`) through `scene/triplanar.ts`. Buildings
    are set pieces: `BoxBuildings` draws only five sheds, so not `facades.ts`.
  - **Weathering (`scene/weathering.ts`):** wall base dirt and rain streaks
    (height from the instance origin), road wheel tracks and oil. Strengths are
    first guesses judged on stills.
  - **Trees (`?look=trees`, `scene/leafcards.ts`):** foliage of `tree`,
    `tree:broadleaf` and `street-tree` as alpha-tested cards with a generated
    canvas texture; about one broadleaf in four is autumn (heading hash). The
    broadleaf crown is a little boxy.
  - **Particles (`?look=particles`, `scene/airdust.ts`):** 600 motes in an 18 m
    box about the camera, dim with the sun. Judge in motion.
  - **Clutter (`?look=clutter`, `scene/wires.ts`):** two sagging wires between
    lamps on the same side of a road. Lamps in the generated city stand 60-70 m
    apart, not `LAMP_SPACING`, so the pairing allows 90 m and about 25 deg; 564
    spans from 1409 lamps. Faint by design.
  - **Roadside (`?look=clutter`, `scene/roadside.ts`):** derived in the renderer
    from the roads, `city/` untouched (owner's pick, 2026-10-03). Deck rails: a
    wall and coping down both edges of the interstate and ramps, which had none
    (394 pieces; not where a road is wholly in a tunnel). Waterside guardrail
    along `embankment` roads where water is within 6 m of the edge (181 panels).
    Red-and-white kerbs on the outside of two-road bends of 25 deg or more (2416
    blocks). **The fence "along the whole wall" is dropped** (owner, 2026-10-03:
    no referent; `03_the_look.md` reworded). #582 is finished.
  - **Next, in the owner's order:** wet roads once #585 gives a weather state
    (parked; do not pull a weather flag forward); a second shadow cascade only
    if a low-sun frame needs it (dusk and sunhaze showed none); races are
    parked behind the look.
  - **Tunnels (`scene/tunnels.ts`):** a tube 7-8 m high because the chase
    camera is 6 m up; under the riverbed it stands proud of the bed, below the
    water. The terrain is single-sided, so a camera under it sees through.
  - **Gotchas:** world units are 135 per metre (`UNITS_PER_METRE`); shots in
    `looksheet` can land differently run to run; never attach a looksheet to a
    PR (git-ignored third-party frames); kill only your own processes.
  - **Worktrees:** the old `crosstown-look`, `-industrial`, `-highmoor` and
    `-lighting` were removed (owner's word). `crosstown-lighting-2` is on
    `look-walls`; `crosstown-main` is the served copy.
- **Start here (2026-10-03; #580 defaults chosen: grade, shadow, ao).**
  - **What changed:** the owner chose `grade`, `shadow` and `ao` as the look.
    They are no longer switches: `LOOK_SWITCHES` is `env`, `pbr`, and
    `cityview.ts` builds the grade, the sun shadow and the AO pass
    unconditionally. Fog is 120-2000 m for everyone. 1920x1080 on the GPU, the
    default look costs 1.8-5.9 ms a frame across the looktime shots; `env,pbr`
    on top is x0.87-1.20.
  - **A trap that was fixed here:** PR #592 was squash-merged before its last
    commits were pushed, so the hour-following grade, `?look=shadow` and
    `?look=env|pbr` never reached main (the earlier note here said they had).
    They landed with this change, cherry-picked from `look-haze-gpu-tools`.
  - **Next:** (1) `env` and `pbr` stay switches until the owner has seen the car
    in motion. (2) A second shadow cascade only if a low-sun frame needs it:
    the dusk and sunhaze frames show none. (3) #580's rest: cloud layer, tunnel
    roof/lining/lights (the tunnel row is an open trench under sky), then #581.
    Looksheets hold git-ignored reference frames: never attach one to a PR.
  - **AO gotchas:** the depth buffer is logarithmic: decode with
    `exp2(d * log2(far + 1)) - 1` (135 world units to the metre).
    `smoothstep` with reversed edges is undefined in GLSL; tune against a raw-AO
    debug output, not the composited frame.
- **Earlier today (the entry below predates #592 and #593).**
  - **PR #591 (branch `look-grade-haze`, worktree `../crosstown-lighting`)**
    holds #580's first step behind `?look=grade`: `scene/grade.ts` (a shader
    pass before ACES: desaturate, mild contrast, cool lifted blacks, warm
    lights, light vignette), street fog 120-2000 m and a wide sun-side glow in
    the sky dome. The haze tuning is done against
    `reference/Screenshot_20261003_050141.png`: the skyline now sits in haze,
    but the whole frame is still duller and greyer than the reference's warm,
    bright horizon. That gap is step 2 below, not more fog.
  - **Tools changed:** `looksheet` and `looktime` render on the GPU (ANGLE
    gl-egl, RTX 3090; `looktime` also lifts vsync and the frame cap). A shot is
    about 25 s, a whole looktime under a minute. `LOOK_GL=software` is the old
    SwiftShader path (not comparable). New shot `sunhaze` (18:00, facing the
    sun's bearing -0.8 from outside downtown); its bearing and hour are
    hard-coded in `tools/lookshots.mjs` against the 17:00 and 19:00 keys in
    `daylight.ts`: keep them in step.
  - **`looktime` baseline** (GPU, 640x400, 40 frames, ms/frame, `none`/`grade`):
    downtown 3.5/3.2, woods 1.6/1.6, industrial 1.6/1.7, wall 1.2/1.3,
    tunnel 1.4/1.6, haze 2.0/1.8, sunhaze 3.7/4.0, dusk 3.3/3.1. The grade costs
    nothing measurable; under about 0.3 ms is noise. Re-record before each phase.
  - **Next, in order:** (1) merge #591 if the owner is happy with it; (2) grade
    that follows the hour and area (warmer, brighter golden-hour horizon; the
    sunhaze row is the test); (3) cascaded sun shadows behind `?look=shadow`,
    the biggest perf risk: read the sun light and shadow setup in
    `scene/cityview.ts` first, compare `looktime` `none;shadow`; then AO, env
    map, clearcoat car paint. Attach a looksheet before/after to each PR.
  - Screenshots in `screenshots/` are git-ignored. The `reference` symlink in
    the worktree needs `/reference` in its `info/exclude`.

- **#580 progress (2026-10-03 night, PR #592):** the grade follows the hour
  (`setGradeHour` in `scene/grade.ts`: a low day sun gets saturation, exposure
  and a warm horizon veil; the area is not used yet). Sun shadows are behind
  `?look=shadow`: one 4096 map, 220 m half-width frustum ahead of the camera,
  texel-snapped (`CityView.shadows`), not true cascades. `looktime`
  `grade;grade,shadow`: downtown 3.1/4.8, woods 1.5/2.2, industrial 1.5/2.4,
  wall 1.3/1.7, tunnel 1.4/2.0, haze 1.9/2.5, sunhaze 4.1/6.1, dusk 2.8/4.8
  (about x1.4). Still to do: a second cascade for long shadows, AO, env map,
  clearcoat paint.

- **#580 env + paint (PR #592):** `?look=env` bakes the sky dome into a PMREM
  map (`CityView.cutEnvironment`, re-cut every 0.25 h) and `?look=pbr` makes
  car bodies `MeshPhysicalMaterial` with a light clearcoat (`CAR_PAINT` in
  `carshape.ts`); the map only goes on physical materials, so buildings are
  untouched. A stronger clearcoat blew the sun's glint out through bloom on the
  player's rear deck: kept subtle on purpose. `LOOK_SIZE=1920x1080` times at
  another size (cost barely moves with size: the frame is draw-call bound).
  `grade,shadow` vs `grade,shadow,env,pbr` at 1080p: x1.01-1.17, sunhaze x1.45
  (probably the first cut of the map; check). Next: AO.

- **Earlier (2026-10-03; the look's phase 0 done, #580 lighting next).**
  - **#579, the look-dev harness, is done** (PRs #588, #589; scene and tools
    only, the sim and citylap baselines untouched). `?look=grade,shadow,ao,env,pbr`
    (or `all`) is parsed in `scene/look.ts` and held by `CityView.switches`; all
    off by default and no-ops until their phase lands (delete a name from
    `LOOK_SWITCHES` once its feature is signed off and becomes the look).
    `npm run looksheet -- --look 'none;grade;grade,ao'` renders seven shots
    (downtown, woods, industrial, wall, tunnel, haze, dusk) per switch set beside
    the matching reference frame, to `screenshots/looksheet.png`; `--shot NAME`
    for one row. `npm run looktime` reports ms per frame per switch set (a
    ratio, since SwiftShader draws on the CPU, about 1.5 s a frame). Shots are
    chosen by rule from the generated city (`tools/lookshots.mjs`), so they
    survive map edits. Attach a before/after sheet to every later phase PR.
  - **What the sheet shows today:** tunnels have no roof, lining or lights (the
    tunnel row is an open trench under sky); no distance haze on the bridge
    row; the wall row is a plain grey box. Those are the first things #580 and
    #582 should move.
  - **Reference frames:** 22 owner screenshots and 16 images in `reference/`
    (git-ignored, third-party, study only). The tunnel, haze and wall gaps are
    filled; the cooling towers (screenshot #21) are not used by any shot yet.
    In a sibling worktree, the `reference` symlink is not covered by the
    `reference/` ignore rule: add `/reference` to the worktree's
    `info/exclude` rather than committing it.
  - **The look (#11) plan:** owner's calls are realistic, matching the reference
    game, HUD waits for their word; #11 stays open as the tracking issue.
    Phase issues: **#580** lighting (grade that follows the hour and area, haze,
    cascaded shadows, AO, env map, cloud layer, clearcoat car paint), **#581**
    CC0 materials, weathering and wet roads, **#582** trees, clutter, wires,
    particles, **#583** building kit, **#584** car models (sourcing undecided),
    **#585** night and weather, **#586** HUD (waiting). The plan is
    `docs/design/03_the_look.md`. Work in a sibling worktree, `scene/` only.
  - **Races are parked behind the look** (owner, 2026-10-03). When they
    resume: tune rival pace and speed-run targets against #347's human pace,
    `RIVAL_CIRCUITS` beyond Rim and Quay, then unpark #469.
  - **Earlier today**, no game code changed:
    - **Industrial's once-over (#575) merged.** Re-running `industrialdraft`
      does not redo the cull (what it removed is gone, so a re-run replaces
      the new works with a smaller set): edit in the Industrial Props editor,
      then `propsync`. Gates and billboards are not drafted there (gates need
      a road; billboards are #469).
    - **Issues closed on the owner's word:** #301 (`CITY_STREET_GRID = false`
      is the end state), #253, #256, #260, #265 (done per area or out of scope
      for the finished map). **#11 was closed by mistake and reopened**: it is
      now "The look: the reference game's daytime grade, haze and materials",
      the one issue holding the look target, pointing at
      `docs/design/03_the_look.md`. #514 and #368 got status comments.
    - **Open issues now:** #266, #269, #259, #368 (undulation and 2-3 hill
      roads not done), #469, #484, #500, #514 (rest of the loop is only the
      `railway-loop-draft` proposal), #11. #14 (car feel) was also closed: its
      blocker #255 shipped.
    - The agent memory folder was trimmed (diary entries cut, five broken
      links fixed); the repo itself is unchanged by that.
  - **Waiting for the owner:** the heat-6 "neither" in `endings`, traffic
    downtown, #484's moved road ends, and the railway (#514, parked).
  - **Branches and worktrees:** `main`, `industrial-dressing` (#575 merged;
    delete on the owner's word), `railway-loop-draft` (#514) and
    `collectibles-frozen` (#469, local). Worktrees: `crosstown-main` (the
    served copy), `crosstown-look` (#579 merged, so it can go once #580 has its own), `crosstown-industrial` (#575 merged, so it can go; a dev
    server on port 5174 may still be running from it) and `crosstown-highmoor`
    (#573 merged, so it can go).
  - **Memory** is a git repo (`ricschuster/claude-memory-nfs-mw-tribute`)
    keyed off the checkout path, so either Claude account sees it.
  - **This file's later sections** predate the cleanup and may contradict
    `docs/architecture.md` and CLAUDE.md, which are current.

## What this is

**Crosstown**, an open-world arcade street racer set in **Kestrel Bay**: a
free-roam city, a ladder of ten rivals, Rep earned from everything you do, cars
found parked around the city, and police pursuits that escalate through six heat
levels.

Original work. It takes its cues from the open-world street-racing genre, not
from any one game. No third-party names, places, cars or assets are in the repo,
and none should be added. If asked to model the map on a specific game's city,
the answer is the *structure* - waterfront, ring road, dense core, bridges as
chokepoints - and never that game's layout.

### The names are placeholders

*Crosstown* and *Kestrel Bay* were picked so the rename was not blocked on a
decision. `Crosstown` appears in `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `index.html`,
`package.json` and the `crosstown.progress.v1` save key; `Kestrel Bay` in the
docs and issue text. The **GitHub slug was left alone on purpose** - renaming it
breaks the Pages URL and every link to it.

## The state of play

**`/` is Kestrel Bay.** One simulation (`cityworld.ts`), one renderer
(`scene/`), one query string: `?renderer=city` flies a free camera over the map
with no car in it, for judging the generator rather than playing it.
[ADR-0006](decisions/0006-the-city-is-the-game.md) is why there is only one of
each.

**What `main` generates today**, measured with `npm run city` against the
pinned seed: **4682 roads, 4661 junctions, 73.9 km of road** - 4167 boulevard
(70.6 km) plus 515 `street`-class driveways at Ashford Point, and no
`arterial`-class roads at all, since `CITY_STREET_GRID` is off and that is the
only thing that lays one. **7 water crossings, 1.24 km of bridge.** **1044
blocks**, of which all but 41 are open ground - `parksFor`
still covers whatever the road network does not claim, and almost nothing
claims anything yet, but it is no longer *literally* nothing: Ashford Point's
driveway houses (#268's pilot, `localstreets.ts`) and Marrow Field's one
hangar (#295, `places.ts`) are real, non-open blocks with real buildings on
them. **41 buildings** as a result - 40 houses plus the hangar - **still 0
interstate, 0 ramps**, because the two flags that build the grid and the
freeway (`CITY_STREET_GRID`, `CITY_FREEWAY` in `constants.ts`) are both
`false`. Their own comments say why: they are a switch, not a deletion, and
`fillSuperblock` and `interstate.ts` are the only code that knows how a
district becomes blocks and how a deck is built - both are wanted back, just
not laid with a ruler (ADR-0009). This describes the city ADR-0007 through
ADR-0009 built. The gridded, buildinged city ADR-0004 through ADR-0006 built
(3102 roads, 841 blocks, 3771 buildings) is what `main` played *before* PR
#273 merged, and nothing about it is true of `main` any more.

Underneath that, four things are real and new since the last time this file
was written. The **ground has height** (ADR-0007): `groundAt` samples a baked
terrain field, and roads are cut and filled into it (`cutfill.ts`, #252), and
since #255 the car feels it (`slope.ts`): a climb lowers top speed and a
descent raises it, gravity pulls along the road, and a crest takes grip away.
Every car on the graph feels the same hill, so the police's fraction of your
top speed holds uphill and down. The **water is one sea with the land as holes in
it** (ADR-0008) rather than a bay-and-river pair drawn over a slab, which is
what let the coastline stop being an edge-to-edge wall and become six separate
bodies of land joined by routed river crossings. **Downtown, the harbour, the
industrial edge and the four places (docks, airfield, quarry, lookout) are
authored polygons** in `city/plan.ts` (ADR-0009) rather than a seeded radius
pick - `npm run plan` checks the polygons still agree with whatever ground the
generator draws for the pinned seed, and today they do (`nothing overlaps`),
though the water model's own idea of where downtown is sits 2.6 km from the
plan's downtown and inside the plan's industrial district, which is one of the
"where the work is" items below. And **the interstate loop is authored data
too now** (#261, `city/freeway.ts`): a hand-drawn 26-point path and 4 tunnel
anchors (downtown, a water crossing, west, north), worked out interactively
against the real terrain/grade/water rules and written by `npm run
freewaysync` from `docs/freeway-edited.json`, replacing the old computed
rectangle. It is built since #371: its ramps are authored too (seven markers
placed in the freeway editor), because `rampsFor` needs a surface junction
beside the deck and with the grid off there was about one.

## How this went wrong twice, and will again

Two failure modes accounted for most of what the first rebuild's very long
session found, and a third showed up finishing this one. All three are cheap
to repeat.

**Almost every number in this game was calibrated against a world that no
longer exists.** `RIVAL_BASE_SPEED_FRAC` came from `npm run feel` racing on a
track that was later deleted; `SPEEDRUN_TARGET` had the same history. When you
find a constant with a confident comment, check what the comment was measured
*on* - and now check whether the ground that comment was measured on still has
a street grid, because a second thing has since started going stale the same
way: `docs/HANDOFF.md`'s own numbers, if nobody updates them when the city
changes shape again.

**The probe is wrong more often than the code.** In one session: `endings`
grew a `--skill` flag that changed nothing, because the skill model lives in
`driveRoute`'s hands and that probe drives the car directly. An impact probe
reported every crash as a low-speed scrape, because it read the speed *after*
the collision had reversed it. If a number looks strange, suspect the probe
first - and when a probe tells you something surprising, make it tell you
*twice*, in two ways. This rebuild's own instance is under "known problems"
below: `npm run pace` failed hard, and it turned out to be the probe, not the
car.

**A long branch drifts red without anyone noticing, because nobody runs the
whole suite against a moving world.** `feat/landmass` reached 37 commits and
128 failing tests before anything counted them, and none of that was a fresh
regression from the commits doing the counting: a disposable worktree at a
commit five back showed the same 38 failures in `city.test.ts` that a run at
HEAD showed. Watching only the files you are touching, on a branch that is
reshaping the ground everything else stands on, means the rest of the suite
can go red under you silently. Run `npm run test` in full every so often on a
branch like this, not just the file you last edited.

## The decisions that shape everything

- [ADR-0003](decisions/0003-separate-simulation-from-rendering.md) - simulation
  split from rendering. The reason any of the rest was survivable, and the
  reason the track could be deleted without deleting the game. Read it as being
  about `cityworld.ts` and `scene/`; the modules it names are gone.
- [ADR-0004](decisions/0004-webgl-free-roam-city.md) - a real 3D WebGL scene.
  Two hard gates forced it: roads over roads, and cameras that leave the car.
- [ADR-0005](decisions/0005-the-shape-of-kestrel-bay.md) - what the city is
  *shaped* like. Rules 1-5 were built as a flat grid; rule 7 (relief) is now
  built differently than this ADR expected it (see ADR-0007) and rule 6
  (landmarks) is still not built.
- [ADR-0006](decisions/0006-the-city-is-the-game.md) - the city is the game,
  and the track sim is deleted.
- [ADR-0007](decisions/0007-relief.md) - the ground gets height. Accepted, then
  sketched (`npm run sketch`), and the sketch found rule 2 wrong before any of
  it was built on real code - see ADR-0008 for what changed as a result.
- [ADR-0008](decisions/0008-a-landmass-and-routed-roads.md) - a landmass
  instead of a slab, and roads that are routed over the ground rather than
  swept across it as curves. Supersedes ADR-0007 rule 2 and amends its rules 4
  and 10.
- [ADR-0009](decisions/0009-kestrel-bay-is-an-authored-map.md) - the districts
  and the four named places are authored data (`city/plan.ts`), not a seeded
  radius pick, and the street grid and elevated interstate are switched off
  while the map is rebuilt from the routed roads outward. This is the decision
  in force right now; read it before touching `generate.ts`.
- [ADR-0010](decisions/0010-sketch-shape-before-generating-it.md) - names the
  pattern behind ADR-0008 and ADR-0009 both: sketch a shape question before
  wiring it into `generate.ts`, and sequence subsystems by what they
  invalidate backward rather than by what they're worth to the player. #268
  is the current live case it applies to.
- [ADR-0011](decisions/0011-the-reference-games-pace.md) - the game is
  played at the reference game's pace: a starter car averages about 0.6 of
  top speed in a race, reached through roads and routes rather than the car,
  with fast roads where the fastest cars earn their speed. Ladder races bring
  the police. Measured against a recording of the reference game
  (`docs/research/`), which the owner treats as authoritative for how the
  game plays.

```

**The city is data.** `city/` turns a seed into junctions, roads, blocks,
districts, water, buildings and street furniture as plain data - no renderer, no
`Math.random`. That is what lets the sim collide with it and the playtests build
one headlessly. The generator must never import three.js. Right now that data
has no blocks and no buildings in it, by the same rule: `CITY_STREET_GRID` and
`CITY_FREEWAY` are read inside `generate.ts` and nowhere else, so turning either
back on is a one-line change whose consequences are everywhere else in the
file.

**Height is real, everywhere, not just on the interstate.** ADR-0004 already
meant two roads at the same map position and different heights were two
different places; ADR-0007 means the *ground* itself has a height at every
point, sampled from a baked field rather than computed as a formula, because
roads get cut and filled into it before anything else is laid. Anything asking
"what is at this position" has to ask about a height, and anything driving on
it now feels the grade.

**Roads are segments, not axis-aligned lines.** `CityRoad.axis` used to exist
and every geometric test leant on it; boulevards and routed roads made it a
lie. Direction comes from the endpoints, and "is this point on this road" is a
distance to a segment.

**Traffic and police live on the graph.** A car is *which road, how far along,
which way*; its position is derived from that. The player is deliberately not
one of these - a player pinned to the graph could not cut across a car park.

### Playing, looking, and measuring

The single most useful thing to know about working here. There are three ways
to find out something is wrong, and they find different things.

**Playing it beats both of the others and is the one that gets skipped.**
Nine of twelve issues from the first rebuild's one long playtest session were
outright bugs the test suite and five green probes had missed entirely: you
could not tell where the road was, a pursuit started for no reason and never
ended, the minimap pointed the wrong way, nothing in the game explained the
Quick Wheel or the repair shops. Do it first, do it often, and write down what
you felt rather than what you think caused it.

**Almost every real defect in the city has been invisible to tests that passed
throughout, and obvious in a picture** - buildings rendering black, water
hidden under the ground plane, districts in a perfect checkerboard, a
waterfront that had swallowed a third of the map. `npm run city` and
`npm run cityshot` are cheap; use them after any change to the generator.

**And the converse: some defects are invisible in a picture and obvious in a
number.** Two live examples from finishing this rebuild's test suite, neither
visible in a screenshot: `npm run pace` said a clean, undamaged car topped out
at 78% of reference speed on the pinned city, against 100% on `main` and every
heat level's cop being faster - which turned out to mean the probe's "hold the
throttle on an empty straight" assumption had stopped being true the day the
network stopped being a grid full of long straights, not that the car could no
longer be outrun; see "known problems" for the fix. And a stationary car under
a live pursuit gets a cop to a stable 50-52 m and no closer, for as long as the
simulation was allowed to run - checked to 180 s - which reads as a navigation
stall rather than a design choice, because nothing about *choosing* to hold
station should look the same at every distance from 11 m to 70 m. That one is
still undiagnosed, in "known problems" below rather than fixed under pressure,
because it sits on a mechanism ("a pursuit can always end") the rest of the
game depends on.

The clearest historical case of "obvious in a number" is `npm run citylap`:
the first time anything *drove* a generated race route end to end, every one
of them turned out to double back on itself, because four independent
shortest paths between four corners shared streets. If a system has never been
exercised end to end, that is where the bugs are - and `routesFor` finding
zero routes on today's pinned city (see "known problems") means the race,
speed-run and claim events have not been exercised end to end on `main` at
all yet.

## Repo mechanics

- Branch, PR, `gh pr merge <n> --auto --squash`. **Auto-merge is a per-PR flag,
  not a repo default** - `allow_auto_merge` only permits it. Enable it in the
  same step as `gh pr create`, or the PR sits with green CI looking broken.
  A branch the size of `feat/landmass` (37 commits, a generator rewrite) is the
  exception: open it for review rather than auto-merging, even with green CI.
- `main` is protected and requires branches to be **up to date**, so a PR that
  falls behind reports `BEHIND` and stalls. Rebase onto `origin/main` and
  force-push with lease.
- Auto-delete of merged branches is on and works.
- Architectural decisions get an ADR. New runtime dependencies need one;
  three.js is still the only one.
- **Do not run Prettier.** There is no `.prettierrc` and no Prettier
  dependency, but the codebase is consistently single-quoted, so
  `npx prettier --write` fetches it, formats with its *defaults*, and silently
  converts whatever it touches to double quotes. That cost a repair PR (#159).
  Match the surrounding style by hand.

## Where the work is

**The plan now (2026-09-29): the map, area by area.** M8 to M12, the plan set
on 2026-09-27 after the reference recording was measured, is done: the map
fits (#363), pace was measured and traffic thinned (#347, #348), nitrous and
drifting (#351), the pursuit reads (M10), races carry heat (M11), and events
per car are decided and built (M12, `docs/design/02`). What is left is the map:

1. **Sablet Wharf (#410).** Decided by the owner: a working container port, a
   second way out by a jump across a channel, and a quay that is a full loop
   and the race route. Build it in a worktree and show the owner screenshots.
2. **Terrain on the road (#368).** Gentle undulation plus two or three hill
   roads within `npm run grades`' caps. `mapfit` measures it (1.5 crests per
   km today).
3. **The other areas** in the order and to the standard in
   [`docs/map-areas.md`](map-areas.md): Halloway Quarry's sign-off (#323),
   Kestrel Head, Ashford Point (#293 is parked - never pick it up), parks,
   midtown, industrial. **Downtown (#268) is last.**

Ride-alongs: collectible density (#266), the railway corridor, and shortcuts
with jumps go with whichever area they land in.

What follows below was written before this plan. It is still accurate about
each issue; the order above supersedes it.

**Downtown goes last, and the checklist is [`docs/map-areas.md`](map-areas.md).**
Decided 2026-09-18: every other area of the map is finished first, one at a
time, the way Marrow Field was, and #268 comes last. That reverses the
ordering the paragraphs below were written under - they call #268 the gate -
so read them for what each issue is, and `map-areas.md` for the order, what
"done" means for an area, and which areas are.

**The map rebuild is not finished, and the gate moved.** #271 (districts
describe streets; places are what streets go to) and #272 (the district plan
as data) are both closed and done: `city/plan.ts` and `city/places.ts` are the
authored data they asked for. What's missing now is not that data but a
decision about how to use it. `CITY_STREET_GRID` - the old ruled arterial mesh
plus a uniform lattice across the whole map - is not coming back; its own
comment in `constants.ts` says so plainly. In its place is a second, newer
generator, `city/localstreets.ts`, gated per district by
`CITY_LOCAL_STREETS_KINDS`: local streets that branch off a district's own
authored major roads and clip to its plan polygon, built and judged one
district at a time. `waterfront` (Ashford Point) is the only entry in that
list today; downtown, midtown and industrial stay without blocks or buildings
until each earns its own pass. Until then there are no street finds, no
roadside breakables, and `routesFor` cannot find the four-corner circuits and
speed runs need - which is why an entire slice of the test suite is `it.skip`
on "zero routes today" rather than failing.
[#301](https://github.com/ricschuster/crosstown/issues/301) tracks the
specific dependency this creates for the freeway loop's ramps.

**[#268](https://github.com/ricschuster/crosstown/issues/268) - downtown
should feel grown, not planned.** This is what has to be answered before
downtown gets its own entry in `CITY_LOCAL_STREETS_KINDS`. Partly landed
already (the parkland-vs-lot foundation, the traffic-density rescale that now
reads the road actually there instead of a fixed count, and Ashford Point
itself as a pilot for "grown, not planned" on the easy case - large lots on
driveways). Downtown is the hard case the issue is actually about:
`fillSuperblock`'s grid versus something that reads as grown. Per ADR-0010,
this wants a `npm run sketch` pass before another attempt goes into
`generate.ts` - routing arterials over terrain was already tried and reverted
once for exactly this reason (`docs/map-exploration.md`, "3. Routing the
arterials").

**[#266](https://github.com/ricschuster/crosstown/issues/266),
[#265](https://github.com/ricschuster/crosstown/issues/265),
[#260](https://github.com/ricschuster/crosstown/issues/260),
[#259](https://github.com/ricschuster/crosstown/issues/259),
[#257](https://github.com/ricschuster/crosstown/issues/257),
[#256](https://github.com/ricschuster/crosstown/issues/256),
[#253](https://github.com/ricschuster/crosstown/issues/253)** - content
density by district, a beltway ring, a periphery of non-city road, buildings
you can drive into, a tunnel breaking pursuit line of sight, street tunnels
and cuttings, and blocks that sit as pads on a hillside rather than boxes. All
of them are things the generator will want once downtown and the rest have
real blocks again (#268); none of them are startable before that.

**[#261](https://github.com/ricschuster/crosstown/issues/261) - the
freeway loop leaving the city proper.** Further along than the rest of this
list: the loop itself is drawn (`city/freeway.ts`, PRs #274-284), a 26-point
path with 4 authored/found tunnel mouths, checked interactively against real
grade and water rules. What is left is not drawing but *connecting* it -
`rampsFor` needs real surface junctions near the loop's edges to place ramps
on, and the current authored network only offers a handful, so this stays
open until #268 gives downtown (and the rest) a real grid to land ramps on.
Re-check the ramp count after that, not before - a low count today is the
known gap, not a regression.

**[#249](https://github.com/ricschuster/crosstown/issues/249) - the land
is lobes joined by channels.** Closed. ADR-0008 is this issue's outcome, and
today's pinned city has six bodies of land, not a slab. The loose thread
`npm run plan` found while checking it - the water model's own notion of
where "downtown" is sitting 2.6 km from the plan's authored downtown and
inside the plan's industrial polygon instead - is fixed too (#274): the
terrain's flat core now centres on the plan's downtown rather than on
`water.town`.

**[#210](https://github.com/ricschuster/crosstown/issues/210) - the
reference driver cannot recover from a wide line.** Closed (PR #297):
`citylap` now fails the run if a route comes back faster with traffic than
empty (traffic can only ever cost a lap time, never buy one back) or does
not finish at all - the guard Foundry Mile needed. Unverified against a real
bad route so far, because `routesFor` finds none on today's map (see
directly below); dormant until routes come back.

**[#295](https://github.com/ricschuster/crosstown/issues/295) - Marrow
Field should be a disused airfield, not an active one.** Partly landed (PR
#298): the runway and taxiway are `surface: 'dirt'` now, found by distance
from `PLAN_RUNWAY` rather than trusted from whichever code path laid the
road (`markAirfieldDirt`, `places.ts`) - it has to work that way because
`CITY_AUTHORED_ROADS` routes the live geometry through `city/roads.ts`'s
hand-drawn network, which carries no `surface` of its own once synced, same
as `embankment` below. One derelict hangar stands beside it. Still open:
weeds, a breached fence, rust, and the access road (routed separately,
stays asphalt) - closer to the iterative editor workflow than a one-shot
change, on purpose.

**[#14](https://github.com/ricschuster/crosstown/issues/14) - tune how
the car feels**, and **[#11](https://github.com/ricschuster/crosstown/issues/11)
- replace vector-drawn art with sprites** (its title is stale; the live
reading, per its own comment, is "everything is boxes" - a running asset-pass
issue, most recently signs and bridge parapets in #198). Both predate this
rebuild and both want the map finished before their old numbers (lap pace,
event length, the ladder's calibration) mean anything again: they were
measured against a grid that no longer exists, and re-measuring them now
would be measuring a city with no buildings and no findable race routes. #14
also has an upstream dependency worth knowing about: #255 (slope changes the
drive) will re-derive `docs/city-baseline.json` and the `HEAT_LEVELS` police
fractions when it lands, so tuning #14 against today's numbers risks redoing
that work.

## Known problems, not papered over

- ~~`npm run pace` fails, and it is not yet known whether that is the car or
  the probe.~~ **Resolved: it was the probe.** It held the throttle from the
  default spawn, which used to sit on a long gridded arterial and on this
  branch's authored map can land within sight of a bend - the car measured 78%
  of top speed and went off-road 3.9 s in, matching a linear 5 s ramp cut
  short at exactly that point. `pace.mjs` now places the car on the longest
  straight `CityRoad` segment in the city instead of trusting the spawn point;
  clean top speed measured 100% again at the time, matching `main`, and the
  gate passed. **It broke a second time since, the same way**: the airfield
  and the quarry access road (#294, #295) gave the network its two longest
  straights, and both are dirt - `DIRT_SPEED_FRAC` caps a car at 85% of its
  top speed there by design, so the probe measured the surface instead of the
  car, clean read CAUGHT at heat 3 through 6, and nothing in the physics was
  wrong. `pace.mjs` now excludes dirt the same way it excludes bridges and
  ramps, places the car a few metres past the *start* of the chosen road
  rather than its midpoint (so the whole length is ahead of it, not half),
  and excludes a road within reach of a repair shop too - `CityWorld.repairs`
  zeroes damage every step a car sits near one (#95), which the previous fix's
  road happened not to be close enough to matter, and the new one was. Clean
  measures 100% again and the gate passes; the damaged rows, still reported
  rather than asserted (#170), are 90/72/81/40% for half-damaged, wrecked,
  wrecked+nitrous and shredded - sensibly different from each other again,
  where the repair-shop bug had them reading identically to clean. No change
  was needed in the car's physics or `HEAT_LEVELS` either time.
- **A stationary car under pursuit cannot be busted, and the search never
  reaches it.** Instrumented directly (`cop.x/y/z`, `cop.offRoad`, frame by
  frame) rather than guessed at, which ruled out the first suspect: `onRoad()`
  inside `cutsCorner` was checking for a road at a hardcoded sea level instead
  of the cop's own height, which is a real bug against #85's own rule ("height
  is a real property of the network") and is fixed, but it made no measurable
  difference to this stall, because the area it was reproduced in is close to
  sea level already. The actual mechanism: `cutsCorner` is designed as a short
  nudge off the road and back, not a second navigator, and a unit rejoins the
  instant `onRoad()` finds *any* nearby road - which in a normally-gridded area
  is almost always true one step after it leaves, so on today's network it
  contributes a single frame of real progress before control passes
  back to ordinary on-road `toward()` navigation for the rest of every cycle.
  Traced on the pinned city: the chaser gets to within 30 m purely on that
  on-road greedy hill-climb, and once no adjacent junction is any closer - the
  car is stopped in the interior of a block, off every road - the heuristic has
  nothing better to offer and is carried onto a road that curves away, gaining
  altitude, never to return. That may be a real design gap rather than a bug:
  `cutsCorner` was built for shortcutting a corner between two roads, and
  nothing today lets a unit close a "stranded in the middle of a block" gap
  the road network never comes within `CITY_BUST_DISTANCE` of. Whether the
  fix is a longer or repeatable cut, a widened search that gives up on the
  road entirely near a stationary target, or something else, is a design
  question and still wants real investigation, not a fix made under the
  pressure that found it (`cityworld.playtest.test.ts`, "closes on a car that
  is standing still, and ends it", currently `it.skip`).
- **`routesFor` finds zero routes on the pinned city.** It searches for four
  corner junctions scattered round a candidate centre, and the authored
  network does not have that kind of junction density near most of the map
  yet. Every circuit, speed run, claim-after-winning-a-race and the Quick
  Wheel's mid-race lock is currently untestable as a result - skipped in the
  test suite, not deleted, and it will come back once #268 lands and more
  districts get real blocks.
- **Bridge spacing is 1795 m at its worst point, against an 800 m promise.**
  `chooseBridges` has no dense arterial candidate set left to spread crossings
  across on the current authored network - a known, measured gap, not a
  loosened test.
- **The freeway loop has almost nowhere to put a ramp yet.** `city/freeway.ts`
  (#261) is a real, merged, 13.6 km authored loop with 4 tunnel anchors, but
  `rampsFor` finds a real surface junction near only a handful of its edges
  while `CITY_STREET_GRID` is off - flipping `CITY_FREEWAY` on locally against
  the real generator produces about one drivable ramp across the whole loop.
  Expected, not a regression: it is the same "no blocks, no buildings" gap as
  everything else on this list, and it closes once #268 lands. Don't chase it
  as a bug before then.
- **The `CITY_` prefix is history, not a distinction.** `CITY_HEAT_RISE`,
  `CITY_COP_LOSE` and `CITY_PURSUIT_RANGE` are named that way because the
  deleted track had different constants meaning different things, and reusing
  one caused three separate bugs. There is only one world now, so the prefix
  is a scar. Leave it: renaming it touches every pursuit file for nothing.
- **Cover is not a mechanic.** The helicopter and `coveredAt` were both
  deleted (#183): a deck overhead and the tunnel are geometry now, and nothing
  watches you from above. If cover should mean something again it needs a new
  thing to mean it against, and that thing has to be *visible* - the test the
  helicopter failed.
- **Both maps agree with each other and the windscreen, and it took a person
  playing to find out they didn't used to.** `scene/mapping.ts` is the one
  conversion (`toMap`), proved against a real camera in `mapview.test.ts`. If
  you add a map, use `toMap`; if you add a marker, check it against the
  windscreen and not against the other markers.
- **The minimap is hard to read in daylight**, and the lighting is not flat
  any more (#180 put a clock in the sim and a palette on it) while shadows
  still do nothing as the sun moves through the day.
- **Blocks stay rectangles wherever they exist**, which today is only
  Ashford Point, but the underlying limitation (#253) survives the rebuild and
  will matter again once #268 brings blocks back to more of the map.

## If you are picking this up cold

Read `CLAUDE.md`, then ADR-0007, ADR-0008 and ADR-0009 in order, then
`docs/map-exploration.md` for the log of how the rebuild actually went - it is
more detailed and more current than this file's summary of it.

**Then look at the city and drive it.** `npm run city` and `npm run cityshot`
first, because a generator change is far easier to judge as a picture than as
a test; then `npm run dev` and drive it, because playing has found more real
defects than every probe and test combined, on both rebuilds.

Then read "Where the work is" above and start at its first item. Downtown
(#268) is the last area, not the first: sketch it (ADR-0010) when every other
area is done.

## The probes, and what each is for

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run test` | unit tests and playtests: 439 passed, 104 skipped, 0 failed as of the last full run on `main` |
| `npm run citylap` | every route, empty and in traffic, then every ladder rival; the only baseline, and the diff is the warning. Also a guard now (#210): fails on a route that never finishes or comes back faster with traffic than empty. Untested against a real route on today's map - see `routesFor` above |
| `npm run playthrough` | the whole game at every level it has one, as a session log |
| `npm run endings` | how a pursuit ends - busted, escaped, or neither - driving and stopped, and `--damage 1` for a wrecked car |
| `npm run pace` | the one *gate*: can an undamaged car outrun every heat level. Passes; measures from the longest straight, not the default spawn - see known problems |
| `npm run grades` | can every arterial/boulevard be climbed - a guard on `cutAndFill` (#252). Passes (4168 of 4168); Ashford Point's driveways (519, never passed to `cutAndFill`) are reported, not gated, and five of those exceed the surface-street cap at 10.5-16% |
| `npm run plan` | does the authored plan still fit the ground the generator makes for the pinned seed - a guard, not a probe |
| `npm run patrol` | twenty minutes with the police live, and what came of it |
| `npm run drivers` | the same routes at four skill levels |
| `npm run city` · `npm run cityshot` | look at it - the city is far easier to judge as a picture than as a test |

Every real defect in the *city* has been found by looking at a picture. Every
real defect in the *balance* has been found by a number. Neither finds what a
person driving finds.
